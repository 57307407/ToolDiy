Official website: <https://chat.openai.com/>

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chat robot based on natural language processing technology, which uses GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology to generate human language responses.

Function:

- Used as a search engine, we can easily use it to search for some information, such as directly asking ChatGPT "how to use ChatGPT".
- Used to find learning materials, such as directly asking ChatGPT "how to learn natural language processing".
- Used to query documents, such as directly asking ChatGPT "what is the usage of the reduce function in the python library functools".
- Used to adjust mood, such as directly asking ChatGPT "how should I date a girl".

Configuration method:

- Search ChatGPT through the browser, click to enter the official website, and click the "Sign in" button to register an account.
- After successful registration, bind an overseas mobile phone number, and enter the verification code in the received verification code to complete the registration.
- It should be noted that ChatGPT cannot be used in Hong Kong for the time being, and even if the node of the ladder is in Hong Kong, even the login to the official website will be restricted.
- If you do not have an overseas mobile phone number, you can obtain it through some mobile phone verification code receiving websites. There are many such websites like ladders, and you only need to google to find them.
