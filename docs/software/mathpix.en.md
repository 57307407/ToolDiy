Mathpix is a tex format formula generation software. Its main function is to identify the formula in the screenshot through OCR technology and generate the corresponding tex code, which can greatly speed up the speed of formula writing in the process of writing a thesis.

Features:

- Support the recognition of handwritten formulas and automatically generate tex codes.
- Support the operation of the digital board, you can write formulas, recognize and generate tex through an external digital board.
- Support table recognition, although not as accurate as formulas, but in most cases the effect is ok.
- Interactive editing interface, when the orc result deviates, you can directly modify it.

Shortcoming:

- There is a limit on the number of times of use, but it can be solved by changing the mailbox. According to my experience, I don’t use that much at all. The normal model is enough, and it’s not worthwhile to pay to upgrade the pro version.
