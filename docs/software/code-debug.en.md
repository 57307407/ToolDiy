`code-debug` is a source-level kernel debugging tool that supports Rust. Currently it is capable of debugging the rCore-Tutorial-v3 operating system and support tracing from kernel to user space. Recent work has been done to implement richer and more robust tracing capabilities using eBPF technology.
