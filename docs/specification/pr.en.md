# Pull Request Message Specification

For Pull Request, please follow the following requirements[^1]:

1. The title should be clear about the purpose of this PR (what **work** is done, what **problem** is fixed).
2. The content should briefly describe the changes. If you fix an issue, please add `fix #xxxx` in the content, where `xxxx` is the issue number.

For the title, such format is recommended:

```plain
<Edit type>(<file name>): <content> (<issue number>)
```

Edit type can be one of the following:

- `feat`: for adding new content.
- `fix`: for fixing existing content errors.
- `refactor`: for refactoring a page (larger changes).
- `revert`: for reverting previous changes.

Examples:

- `fix(sepecification/specification): edit code comment to make it more clear`
- `fix: plugins/xxx not in directory (#2)`
- `feat(software/mathpix): official website`
- `refactor(specification/template): tidy up page content`
